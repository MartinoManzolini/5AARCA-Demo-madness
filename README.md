# AR app for autism

The Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a syndrome which characterised by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. People who suffers from this disorder find themselves uncomfortable to adapt with surroundings and environment around them. They find it difficult to interact with other people especially strangers. Thus, this project is shaped to help this category of people to ease their daily lives. The aim of this project is to create an experience of travelling from one station to another ons at Milanoâ€™s Metro stations. It brings them this opportunity to start their journey from outside the metro station and help them buy ticket in case they don't have one and then navigate them through turnstile and finally the metro itself. Meanwhile, the system of Conversational Agent will help them not to be confused and panicked by speaking to them like a real person and users can speak to it as well. This project can be a good start to be extended in other aspects and areas and although there were quite some challenges, it was good opportunity to make Augmented Reality a bridge to help autistic people.
